## ‚ùì FAQ

- **When should I use this?**
  When you want to quickly publish a blog from a folder of `.txt` or `.md` files with minimal setup.

- **Why the name ‚Äút.t.t‚Äù?**
  Originally short for `the.tslimi.tk`, my old blog. You're welcome to interpret it however you like now.

- **Why PHP?**
  Back in the day of cPanel-based free hosting, PHP was often the only server-side language supported ‚Äî so, PHP it was.

## üìú Changelog

This project was first built when I was in middle school. In the Dec 2020 revamp, the following changes were made:

- Switched to using CDNs and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for dependencies. (No, it had not dependency manager back then.)
- Removed the ‚Äúquick access‚Äù list ‚Äî use your favorite search engine instead.
- Removed `_intro.txt` support for rendering simplicity.
- Dropped the custom caching logic to reduce complexity.
- Replaced hand-rolled CSS with [mvp.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/) for cleaner HTML and modern styling.
- Adopted a full favicon set generated via [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).

On Apr 21, 2025, I had ChatGPT rewrite this whole README file.
